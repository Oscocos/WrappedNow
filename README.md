## üöÄ Try It Yourself

You can use this project **as-is** to explore your own Spotify data.

üí¨ _I‚Äôd love it if you did! If people are using this, it means something I made is bringing value to someone._

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note on Spotify Limitations**:  
Spotify only allows specific users to access development-mode apps. Feel free to email me at **olscocos@gmail.com** with your email and I can add you, but it would probably be easier to just setup your own.

If you are not allowlisted, you may encounter issues using the live version.

**To make this work for you**, follow the setup below to use your own Spotify Developer credentials.

## üõ† Requirements

To run the app locally, you‚Äôll need:

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A local server (e.g., [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), or `http-server` via npm)

You can run it easily with VS Code + npm:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever localhost is launched) in your browser.

üîê Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you‚Äôll log in **via Spotify**, not through this site.  
Your credentials are handled securely through Spotify‚Äôs own platform.

- Log in and **create a new app**
- Copy your **Client ID**

### 2. Set a Redirect URI

In your app settings:
- Add `http://localhost:5173/callback` (or your deployed site‚Äôs `/callback` path)

### 3. Update the App

Open `script.js` and replace the default values:

```js
const clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE";
const redirectUrl = "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI_HERE";
```
