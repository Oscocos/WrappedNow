# 🎧 Wrapped Now

![Wrapped Now preview](example.png)

**Wrapped Now** is an interactive web app that shows you your personalized Spotify Wrapped — anytime you want!  
View your top artists or songs across different time ranges (1 month, 6 months, or 1 year), with clickable cards and Spotify-integrated data.

## 🚀 Try It Yourself

You can use this project **as-is** to explore your own Spotify data.

💬 _I’d love it if you did! If people are using this, it means something I made is bringing value to someone._

⚠️ **Note on Spotify Limitations**:  
Spotify only allows specific users to access development-mode apps. If you are not allowlisted, you may encounter issues using the live version.

**To make this work for you**, follow the setup below to use your own Spotify Developer credentials.

## 🛠 Requirements

To run the app locally, you’ll need:

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A local server (e.g., [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), or `http-server` via npm)

You can run it easily with VS Code + npm:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

🔐 Don’t worry — you’ll log in **via Spotify**, not through this site.  
Your credentials are handled securely through Spotify’s own platform.

## ⚙️ Use Your Own Spotify Credentials

If you'd like to fully customize or deploy the app:

### 1. Create a Spotify Developer App

- Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
- Log in and **create a new app**
- Copy your **Client ID**

### 2. Set a Redirect URI

In your app settings:
- Add `http://localhost:5173/callback` (or your deployed site’s `/callback` path)

### 3. Update the App

Open `script.js` and replace the default values:

```js
const clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE";
const redirectUrl = "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI_HERE";
```
